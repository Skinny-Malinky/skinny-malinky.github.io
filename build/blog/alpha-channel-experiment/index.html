<h3>Stressing out</h3>

<p>Stress! That&rsquo;s my aim. I wanted to go further than last time. It&rsquo;s clear to me that time is an important element as the last sketch felt <a href="https://www.struanfraser.co.uk/blog/open-frameworks-and-processing#trippy-webcam" target="_blank">disconnected and loose</a>. This has much more of a satisfying, <em>disconcerting</em>* feel to it. Whenever I use it I feel like I&rsquo;m becoming more stressed just by appearing and moving in the image. It almost makes you want to stop moving. </p>

<p>I suspect this won&rsquo;t be the end of my interest in alpha channels. I&rsquo;ve been looking at an awful lot of <a href="https://www.pinterest.co.uk/struanf/80s-90s-retro-design/" target="_blank"> old VHS covers on pinterest which may have something to do with it.</a></p>

<p>It works by allowing the red alpha channel to move around in real time but only occasionally capturing the blue and green channels&rsquo; frames. They also have a blend mode applied to them as appeared in the previous sketch.</p>

<p>Hopefully I&rsquo;ll be able to produce a p5js version some time soon so I can share it around but until then I&rsquo;ll settle for just listening to Carpenter Brut until my ears bleed –</p>
