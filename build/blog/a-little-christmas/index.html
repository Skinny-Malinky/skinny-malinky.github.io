<h3>Hello again test test, is anyone there</h3>

<p>It&rsquo;s been a long time since I&rsquo;ve posted anything here and like everyone, life&rsquo;s very different to what it was in 2019. I&rsquo;ve finished a bout of studying citizenship and design, I&rsquo;ve worked with a group of friends to make some fun wee games and I&rsquo;ve started a new job in a new city.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve just uploaded a little Christmas sketch as invited to by the ever kind and creative <a href="https://twitter.com/vividfax">Rianna</a> and <a href="https://twitter.com/mtrc">Mike</a>. It&rsquo;s now available on day 20 of the Generative Advent Calendar. You&rsquo;ll have to forgive the way it looks, it&rsquo;s been a very busy Christmas and I haven&rsquo;t written code properly for some time. That being said though, I&rsquo;m pleased with what it turned into in it&rsquo;s &ldquo;My first HTML project&rdquo; style. I strongly recommend you have a look at the other contributors though, they&rsquo;re much better!</p>

<p>In the depths of the pandemic, Rianna and I co-worked on a bunch of little creative sketches which turned into Games for Crows. I spent a good bit more time thinking about game design than I ever had previously and we carved out a small niche in Games for Crows. We wanted to make things that were reflective and relaxing, it seemed appropriate in the midst of a pandemic. Rianna then became extremely prolific and produced a whole multitude of games tools and fidget toys.</p>

<p>Later we invited Ryan and Matt to both write and produce illustrations for a game that plays with different ideas of who we are and how we participate in our community and wider society. Those games are still in a cupboard that has been firmly shut since the pandemic but I will get round to releasing at least one of them this year.</p>

<p>And back to the Christmas sketch. This was a very small contribution to imagining things differently. Years ago, I heard an expert describe how authors spend chapters and chapters trying to get the reader to project themself onto the protagonist in a book. In a game, you need only pick up the controller and push forward, and magically the projection has already happened. You&rsquo;re movement and the character&rsquo;s is one. It&rsquo;s so much easier to reveal new possibilities and ideas of what&rsquo;s possible through characters in computer games because projection and the associated empathy is much smoother. Anyway, I hope you all have some proper restful holidays, I&rsquo;m off to drink a few pints of gravy!</p>
